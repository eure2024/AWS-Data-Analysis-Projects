Project Background:

The project accesses the NYC Open Data project to connect to the Fire Incident Dispatch Data API and pushes the data into an Elastic OpenSearch cluster using AWS. 
The main.py Python script includes the Python code that executes commands to connect to the API and upload the data in rows. The Dockerfile includes the codes necessary to connect to Python and access the Python script. 
Once the data is loaded and available in OpenSearch, I created visualizations in Kibana to analyze the data. The visualizations include a gauge that shows the total number of rows gathered 
from the Fire Incident Dispatch Dataset. The data generated by the Starfire Computer Aided Dispatch System includes information about the assignment of resources and the Fire Department's response to the 
emergency.
